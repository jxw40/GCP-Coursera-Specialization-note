# GCP-Coursera-Specialization-note

This is my note (very crude) on Coursera Specialization produced by Google Cloud
* Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform
* Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform

courses recourses/exercises are on 
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/tree/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive

Most slides of the course are currently unavailable(2019.2), check out on Coursera if you enroll in the courses.

I do not own any of the slides/codes or pictures containing the slides, the copyright belongs to Google Cloud and Coursera.

Feel free to copy or edit my (terrible) notebook, make your own version of notes until the slides are available to you.
