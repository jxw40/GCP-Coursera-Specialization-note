The \"trick\" is to do the first part of your aggregation in BigQuery, get back a Pandas dataset and then work with the smaller Pandas dataset locally.

    "For each lab, you get a new GCP project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you signed into Qwiklabs using an incognito window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Note the lab's access time (for example, img/time.png and make sure you can finish in that time block.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. When ready, click img/start_lab.png.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Note your lab credentials. You will use them to sign in to Cloud Platform Console. img/open_console.png\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Click Open Google Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Click Use another account and copy/paste credentials for this lab into the prompts.\n",
    "> If you use other credentials, you'll get errors or incur charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.\n",
