    "\n",
    "* Setup your linear classifier model with 10 classes (one for each possible digit 0 through 9)\n",

    "* Define and create your EstimatorSpec in tensorflow to create your custom estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define and run your train_and_evaluate function to train against the input dataset of 60,000 images and evaluate your model's performance\n"
