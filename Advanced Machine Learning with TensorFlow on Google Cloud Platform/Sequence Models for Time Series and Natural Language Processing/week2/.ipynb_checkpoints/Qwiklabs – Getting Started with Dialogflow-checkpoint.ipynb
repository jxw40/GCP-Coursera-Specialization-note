    "\n",
    "### Create your first Dialogflow agent\n",
    "To create a Dialogflow agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a browser and log in to Dialogflow.\n",
    "2. Click Create agent in the left menu.\n",
    "4767285463efdad7.png\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enter your agent's name, default language, and default time zone, then click the Create button. 32615f1898bb1252.png\n",

    "\n",
    "The middle of the page will show the list of intents for the agent. By default, Dialogflow agents start with two intents. Your agent matches the Default Fallback Intent when it doesn't understand what your users say. The Default Welcome Intent greets your users. These can be altered to customize the experience.\n",
    "\n",

    "On the right is the Dialogflow simulator. This lets you try out your agent by speaking or typing messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query your agent\n",
    "Agents are best described as NLU (Natural Language Understanding) modules. These can be included in your app, product, or service and transform natural user requests into actionable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "65ea14ce62e3c036.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to try out your agent! In the Dialogflow simulator on the right, click into the text field that says Try it now, type hi, and press enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just spoke to your Dialogflow agent! You may notice your agent understood you. Since your input matched to the Default Welcome Intent, you received one of the default replies inside the welcome intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that your agent doesn't understand you, the Default Fallback Intent is matched and you receive one of the default replies inside that intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Default Fallback Intent reply prompts the user to reframe their query in terms that can be matched. You can change the responses within the Default Fallback Intent to provide example queries and guide the user to make requests that can match an intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create your first intent\n",
    "Dialogflow uses intents to categorize a user's intentions. Intents have Training Phrases, which are examples of what a user might say to your agent. For example, someone wanting to know the name of your agent might ask, \"What is your name?\", \"Do you have a name?\", or just say \"name\". All of these queries are unique but have the same intention: to get the name of your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To cover this query, create a \"name\" intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the plus add next to Intents in the left menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the name \"name\" into the Intent name text field.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the Training Phrases section, click Add Training Phrases enter the following, pressing enter after each entry:\n",
    "  * What is your name?\n",
    "  * Do you have a name?\n",
    "  * name\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the Responses section, click Add Response enter the following response:\n",
    "  * My name is Dialogflow!\n",
    "fd91a8fc36247980.png 5. Click the Save button.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Try it out!\n",
    "e729697de0f2c154.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Now try asking your agent for its name. In the simulator on the right, type \"What's your name?\" and press enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your agent now responds to the query correctly. Notice that even though your query was a little different from the training phrase (\"What's your name?\" versus \"What is your name?\"), Dialogflow still matched the query to the right intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dialogflow uses training phrases as examples for a machine learning model to match users' queries to the correct intent. The machine learning model checks the query against every intent in the agent, gives every intent a score, and the highest-scoring intent is matched. If the highest scoring intent has a very low score, the fallback intent is matched.\n",

    "## Extract data with entities\n",
    "This section describes how to extract data from a user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add parameters to your intents\n",
    "Parameters are important and relevant words or phrases in a user's query that are extracted so your agent can provide a proper response. You'll create a new intent with parameters for spoken and programming languages to explore how these can match specific intents and be included in your responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new intent by clicking on the plus add next to Intents in the left menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Name the intent \"Languages\" at the top of the intent page.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the following as Training phrases:\n",
    "  * I know English\n",
    "  * I speak French\n",
    "  * I know how to write in German\n",
    "9f99c39716a71508.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Dialogflow automatically detects known parameters in your Training phrases and creates them for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the Training phrases section, Dialogflow fills out the parameter table with the information it gathered:\n",
    "  * The parameter is optional (not required)\n",
    "  * named language\n",
    "  * corresponds to the system entity type @sys.language\n",
    "  * has the value of $language\n",
    "  * is not a list\n",
    "Note: If entities aren't automatically detected, you can highlight the text in the Training phrase and manually annotate the entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use parameter data\n",
    "1e24fd4a42bdaf08.png\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a parameter can be used in your responses. In this case, you can use $language in your responses and it will be replaced with the language specified in the query to your agent.\n",

    "  * Wow! I didn't know you knew $language\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it out!\n",
    "626007876cbc6424.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, query your agent with \"I know Russian\" in the simulator in the right panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see in the bottom of the simulator output that Dialogflow correctly extracted the language parameter with the value \"Russian\" from the query. In the response, you can see \"Russian\" was correctly inserted where the parameter value was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create your own entities\n",
    "You can also create your own entities, which function similarly to Dialogflow's system entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an entity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the plus add next to Entities in the left menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enter \"ProgrammingLanguage\" for the name of the entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click on the text field and add the following entries:\n",
    "  * JavaScript\n",
    "  * Java\n",
    "  * Python\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When you enter an entry, pressing tab moves your cursor into the synonym field. Add the following synonyms for each entry: 7f2ce5ab86b464bc.pngClick the Save button.\n",
    "Each entity type has to have the following:\n",
    "  * a name to define the category (ProgrammingLanguage)\n",
    "  * one or more entries (JavaScript)\n",
    "  * one or more synonyms (js, JavaScript)\n",
    "Dialogflow can handle simple things like plurality and capitalization, but make sure to add all possible synonyms for your entries. The more you add, the better your agent can determine your entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add your new entities\n",
    "Now that we've defined our entity for programming languages, add Training Phrases to the \"Languages\" intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on Intents in the left menu, and then click on the \"Languages\" intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the following as Training phrases: bdf19643e9a83283.png\n",
    "  * I know javascript\n",
    "  * I know how to code in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You should see the programming languages automatically annotated in the Training phrases you entered. This adds the ProgrammingLanguage parameter to the table, which is below the Training phrases section. cfc3cdc2079f9774.png 98144d1b98cb37b2.png\n",

    "67b4fd1300f4adb8.png\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent matching with follow-up intents\n",
    "Follow-up intents are only matched after the parent intent has been matched. Since this intent is only matched after the \"Languages\" intent, we can assume that the user has just been asked the question \"How long have you known $language?\". You'll now add Training Phrases indicating users' likely answers to that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "38e74f1867ee4a6a.png\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on Intents in the left menu and then click on the \"Languages - custom\" intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the following Training Phrases:\n",
    "  * 3 years \n",
    "  * about 4 days\n",
    "  * for 5 years\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click the Save button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try it out\n",
    "Try this out in the Dialogflow simulator on the right. First, match the \"Languages\" intent by entering the query I know French. Then, answer the question How long have your known $language? with about 2 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "80dafbbf985df5a8.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite there being no response for the second query (\"about 2 weeks\"), we can see our query is matched to the correct intent (\"Languages - custom\") and the duration parameter is correctly parsed (\"2 weeks\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intents and contexts\n",
    "Now that your follow-up intent is being matched correctly, you need to add a response. In \"Languages - custom\" you've only asked for the duration the user has known the language, and not the referenced language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To respond with a parameter gathered from the \"Languages\" intent, you need to know how follow-up intents work. Follow-up intents use contexts to keep track of if a parent intent has been triggered. If you inspect the \"Languages\" intent, you'll see \"Languages-followup\" listed as an Output context, prefaced by the number 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "773bf5df6bce12fe.png\n",
    "\n",
    "After the \"Languages\" intent is matched, the context \"Languages-followup\" is attached to the conversation for two turns. Therefore, when the user responds to the question, \"How long have you known $language?\", the context \"Languages-followup\" is active. Any intents that have the same Input context are heavily favored when Dialogflow matches intents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on Intents in the left navigation and then click on the \"Languages - custom\" intent.\n",
    "f72f77ab8f711d5.png\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the intent has the same input context (\"Languages-followup\") as the output context of \"Languages\". Because of this, \"Languages - custom\" is much more likely to be matched after the \"Languages\" intent is matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contexts and parameters\n",
    "Contexts store parameter values, which means you can access the values of parameters defined in the \"Languages\" intent in other intents like \"Languages - custom\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the following response to the \"Languages - custom\" intent and click the Save button:\n",
    "  * I can't believe you've known #languages-followup.language for $duration!\n",
    "5641f3e48acdcbf8.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the changes. Now you can query your agent again and get the proper response. First enter \"I know French\", and then respond to the question with \"1 month\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4d80e08cebfed7c5.png\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see that the language parameter value is retrieved from the context.\n",
