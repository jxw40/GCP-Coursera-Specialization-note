    "TensorFlow Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A module is a self-contained piece of a TensorFlow graph, along with its weights and assets, that can be reused across different tasks in a process known as transfer learning, which we covered as part of the course on Image Models.\n",

If that happens, you may be able to reconnect using the command â€˜datalab connect mydatalabvm' in your new Cloud Shell. Once connected, try the above step again.\n",
