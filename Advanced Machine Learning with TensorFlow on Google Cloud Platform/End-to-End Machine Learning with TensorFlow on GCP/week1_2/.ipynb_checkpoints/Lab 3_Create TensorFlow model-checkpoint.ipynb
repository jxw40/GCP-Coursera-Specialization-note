    "\n",
    "In this lab #3, you create a TensorFlow model using the high-level Estimator API. You will train this model on the subsample of data created in the previous lab. Once you have the model working, in the next lab, you will train the model on the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good practice to start with a simple model if you can. Thus you should start out with a linear model, then try a deep neural network model, and finally build a wide and deep model.\n",
